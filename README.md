# Hospitality-EDA-Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in the hospitality domain. While the dataset is not shared due to restrictions, the project outlines the steps for data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights generation.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, handled duplicates, and standardized data formats.
- **Data Transformation**: Aggregated data and reshaped it for visualization.
- **Visualization**: Trends, seasonal analysis, and cancellation rates using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Insights**: Generated actionable recommendations for business improvements.

## Process
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Example: Removed null values in `booking_date` and standardized `season` values.
2. Data Transformation:
   - Example: Grouped data by `season` and calculated average cancellation rates.
3. Visualization:
   - Example graphs include seasonal trends, booking rates, and customer demographics.

## Tools
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for step-by-step analysis.

## Note
The dataset used in this project cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. However, the notebook includes clear examples and comments for understanding the process.
